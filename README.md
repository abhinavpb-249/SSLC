## SSLC percentage Calculator
A website to calculate the percentage from the grades of SSLC exam.
<br>
The SSLC(Secondary School Leaving Certificate) is obtained on passing the grade 10 public examination, which is commonly referred to as 'class 10 board examinations' in India. SSLC is a common eligibility examination popular in many states in India, especially Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.

Usually grades aren't given along with the certificate. So students have to calculate it.<br>
That is the reason this project was initiated.
